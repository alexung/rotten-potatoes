Movie.create(title: "The Room", synopsis: "This film centers on Johnny, a man who has it all; great friends, a good job, and a gorgeous fianc√©e named Lisa. But Lisa's innocent act masks the fact that she's looking to bring Johnny down, and her manipulations are tearing Johnny apart. As Lisa informs her cancer-ridden mother, Claudette, that Johnny hit her (and he did not hit her, that is bull$&*t, he did not!), Johnny's best friend, Mark, finds his resistance to Lisa's seductive charms weakening. Meanwhile, local orphan Denny looks up to Johnny, and needs the older man's help after the teen rips off a drug dealer. What kind of drugs? It doesn't matter. Then guys play football in tuxedos, because you can play football anywhere. This movie is seriously not to be missed.", poster_url: "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/89/91/10899157_det.jpg", potatometer: "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/89/91/10899157_det.jpg")
